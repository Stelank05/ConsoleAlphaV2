# ConsoleAlphaV2

I wanted to make a Game, so I started making prototypes in the Console, and this is the 2nd Version, which adds 2 Main Features over V1:
- Entering Multiple Series
- Saving + Reloading

Features Retained from V1:
- Multiple Seasons
  - Team Updating in the Off Season
    - Team Name
    - Delete Crews
    - Modify Crews
    - Add Crews
  - Team Stat Updates Between Seasons
- Results Saving (Expanded with V2 to include more Debug Data)
- Saving Team Results
  - Standings Saved after Each Race with Full Race Results until (and including) that Round.
- Standings
  - Entrants
  - Manufacturers
  - Inclusion of a Countback System to settle ties
 
Don't intend to update this further, in favour of a New Version with a UI and better integrated Save Loading + Other Features
